# Components by name, through Bevy's reflection: the script reads its own Transform as a Hash,
# changes one number, and writes it back. Nothing in rubevy knows what a Transform is — the
# type registry does (`app.register_type::<T>()`), so a game's own component works the same way.
# See examples/components.rs.
