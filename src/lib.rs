//! rubevy: run mruby bytecode inside Bevy, using the [SabiRuby](sabiruby) VM.
//!
//! One VM for the whole app ([`ScriptWorld`]), and one **task** per script
//! (mruby-task): a [`Script`] component becomes a task of the scheduler, and
//! every frame the plugin gives the scheduler a budget of instructions. A task
//! that calls `sleep` costs nothing until its time comes, so hundreds of
//! scripts can sit on entities and wake only when they have something to do.
//!
//! What a script sees of the host:
//! * `$rubevy` — a Hash refreshed at the head of every frame (`:frame`,
//!   `:delta`, `:time`).
//! * `Rubevy.entity` — the entity this script is attached to, read off the task
//!   the scheduler is running. It is a `Rubevy::Entity` object, which carries
//!   `Entity::to_bits` as a handle the VM never reads through (`Vm::data_new`);
//!   `to_i` gives the number, `==` compares by it.
//! * `Rubevy.log`, `Rubevy.spawn`, `Rubevy.despawn`, `Rubevy.set_position`,
//!   `Rubevy.move_to` — these do not touch the Bevy world from inside the VM
//!   (a native cannot); they put a command on a queue that a system drains
//!   after the frame's scripts have run.
//! * **Components by name**: `entity[:Transform]` answers a Hash of its
//!   fields, `entity[:Transform] = hash` writes back the fields the Hash names,
//!   and `entity.has?`, `entity.components` and `Rubevy.find(:Npc)` say what is
//!   where. It goes through Bevy's reflection, so no type is named in rubevy —
//!   a game's own component joins in by being
//!   `#[derive(Reflect)] #[reflect(Component)]` and registered. A read waits
//!   for the host, which is one frame.
//! * **Events**: `Rubevy.subscribe(:hit)` answers a `Task::Queue` the game
//!   pushes onto ([`ScriptWorld::publish`]), so a script waits for something to
//!   happen exactly as it waits for an answer — in its own task, or in one it
//!   made with `Task.new`.
//! * `puts`/`p` output is forwarded to Bevy's log.
//!
//! Where a game's own systems go in the frame is [`RubevySet`]: an answering
//! system in [`RubevySet::Answer`] makes a `Rubevy.ask` round trip cost one
//! frame.
//!
//! A script may `require` another, which reads from the asset directory
//! ([`RubevyPlugin::with_asset_root`], `assets` by default): `.mrb` always,
//! `.rb` only in a build with the `ruby-source` feature, which brings the
//! reference compiler along.
//!
//! Scripts share one VM, so they share globals and constants. That is the
//! design, not an oversight: a game's scripts are written together. A use that
//! needs isolation wants a second VM, which this plugin does not build yet.

/// | [`RubevySet::Tick`] | `tick_scripts`, `drain_commands`, `apply_component_writes` | the scripts run, and what they asked for becomes a [`Request`] |
/// | [`RubevySet::Answer`] | rubevy's own `answer_components` — **and the host's answering systems** | the questions this frame asked are answered before the frame ends |

/// **What it is worth.** A round trip then takes **one frame**: the `Rubevy.ask` happens in
/// `Tick` and leaves a command behind, `drain_commands` (still `Tick`) turns it into a
/// [`Request`], the host answers it in `Answer`, and the script wakes in the next frame's
/// `Tick`. That one frame is checked in `tests/scheduling.rs`.
///
/// **What it costs not to use it.** A system that is in no set is ordered against nothing, so
/// where Bevy runs it is up to the executor and the rest of the app. Almost everywhere is fine
/// — before the sets, after them, in `PreUpdate`, in `PostUpdate` — because anything that
/// answers before the *next* `Tick` is soon enough. The one place that is not is **between
/// `tick_scripts` and `drain_commands`**: there the system misses the question this frame asked
/// (it becomes a [`Request`] a moment later) and answers the previous frame's too late for this
/// frame's scripts, so every round trip costs **two** frames. That is what rubevy_games measured
/// with an unordered answering system: 2.0 frames for every question the game answered against
/// 1.0 for every question rubevy answered itself
/// (`docs/worklog/2026-09-16-showpieces-d2-d3.md` there). The cost was not a rule of the bridge,
/// it was where the system happened to land — and the point of the set is that `Deliver` and
/// `Answer` are outside that window by construction. (Do not put an answering system *inside*
/// [`RubevySet::Tick`]: that is the one set that contains the window.)
///
