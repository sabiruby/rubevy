//! Components by name, both ways: a `&dyn PartialReflect` read as a Ruby value, and a Ruby
//! value written back over one.
//!
//! There is no glue per component type here. Bevy's reflection says what a `Transform` is made
//! of at run time — a struct of three fields, one of them a `glam::Vec3` of three `f32` — and
//! that is enough to build the Hash a script sees and to read one back. A game's own component
//! joins in by being `#[derive(Reflect)] #[reflect(Component)]` and registered
//! (`app.register_type::<T>()`); nothing in rubevy names it.
//!
//! **What a value looks like on the Ruby side.**
//!
//! | reflected | Ruby |
//! |---|---|
//! | struct | Hash, keys as Symbols (`{translation: …, rotation: …}`) |
//! | `glam::Vec2` / `Vec3` / `Vec3A` / `Vec4` / `Quat` | Array of Floats — these are structs of `x`, `y`, … in bevy_reflect, but a script wants `tf[:translation][0]` |
//! | tuple struct, tuple, array, list | Array |
//! | map | Hash |
//! | set | Array |
//! | enum, unit variant | the variant's name as a Symbol (`:Hidden`) |
//! | enum, struct variant | a one-entry Hash whose value is a Hash of the fields, `{Srgba: {red: …}}` |
//! | enum, tuple variant | a one-entry Hash whose value is an **Array** of the fields, `{Orthographic: [{scale: 1.0}]}` |
//! | opaque | Float, Integer, true/false, String, or a `Rubevy::Entity` — see [`opaque_to_ruby`] |
//! | anything else | nil |
//!
//! **What a write does.** A Hash is applied field by field, so a field the Hash does not name
//! is left as it was — which is what makes reading a component, changing one number and
//! writing it back cost one round trip rather than two. An Array applied to a struct goes by
//! position, which is how `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` reaches a `Vec3`. A Symbol switches an enum to
//! that (unit) variant. The fields of a *tuple* variant are written by the same Array the read
//! answers and cannot be named — a tuple variant's fields have no names in bevy_reflect, not
//! even `"0"`. A value of a kind the field cannot take is reported, not applied.
