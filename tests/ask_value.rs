//! `Rubevy.ask` carries a Hash or an Array to the host as the value it is (`Arg::Value`), not as
//! its `to_s` and not as a copy: the host is handed the Ruby object, registered with the
//! collector for as long as the `Request` lives and let go of when the request does.
//!
//! What the tests here are actually about is the collector. A value the host holds is a value
//! nothing in the VM points at — the script has parked, the frame that built the literals is
//! gone — so it is alive only because `Vm::gc_register` says so, and it dies when the last
//! `Request` naming it is dropped. Both halves are checked with a real collection.
